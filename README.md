This is an attempt to build a neural network (CNN) to do parameterized captcha recognition. It uses a slightly modified version of claptcha (https://github.com/kuszaj/claptcha/) for generating training and test set. 
This work takes inspiration from https://github.com/scnuhealthy/cnn_keras_captcha and the captcha_params.py file is the same.

Just run the notebook for creating the training set, fitting the model and obtaining the performances.
